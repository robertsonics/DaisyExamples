## Description

This is an advanced example application for the Daisy Rogue board. It demonstrates how to take advantage of the board's
10 audio output channels, MIDI in and microSD card.

This is an ongoing work-in-progress; I'm using it to develop and test the Daisy Rogue board support in libDaisy.
